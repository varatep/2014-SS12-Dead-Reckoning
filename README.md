2014-SS12-Dead-Reckoning
========================

App to guide two blind people to find each other using dead reckoning methods.


looking back on this app -- in the 24 hours we had to create this app, we made about 95 commits... that's amazing.
about 8 of those 24 hours were probably spent trying to fix merge conflicts and teaching other teammates how to git
